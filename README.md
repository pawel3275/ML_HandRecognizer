# AI hand recognizer

Application for prediction of how many fingers were shown to the camera as an input. Artificial model takes as an input image from the camera after preprocessing it using openCV, and later on passes it to the convolutional layers. 

Model during training should reach accuracy of around 94%. Application was created with the main purpose to understand and practice how neural networks with convolutional layers work.
